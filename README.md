## Tech Highlights

- Full-stack platform: React 19 frontend + FastAPI backend, live and integrated
- Modular AI system architecture with clean layer separation
- Production-style FastAPI backend with Pydantic v2 validation
- PostgreSQL data layer via Supabase
- **Medallion data pipeline**: Bronze (raw) → Silver (normalised) → Gold (as-of feature views)
- **As-of / leakage contract**: every training row uses only data available before `sale_date - 1 day`
- **Time-based evaluation**: rolling-origin cross-validation (no random splits)
- Real NYC government data: Rolling Sales, PLUTO, DOF Assessment, ACRIS, J-51 Exemption
- End-to-end ML pipeline: ingestion → Silver normalisation → Gold feature build → training → inference
- XGBoost regression with log-transformed target for residential property valuation
- **Optuna hyperparameter search** on the strict time split per segment
- ModelRegistry pattern: metadata-driven, segment-routable, lazy-loading model serving
- **4 trained spine v4 models** with overfitting-gate guardrails: one_family, multi_family, condo_coop, rentals_all (pooled walkup + elevator)
- Full building-class routing to dedicated segment models; `07` and `08` both route to the pooled `rentals_all` model
- **Optional BBL + as_of_date on inference** — DOF / ACRIS / J-51 / PLUTO features loaded from Silver + Gold parquets at request time (same as-of rules as training)
- BallTree haversine subway-distance feature (MTA stations) at training and inference
- Feature importance / explainability artifact persisted after training
- Global explainability endpoint: `GET /model/feature-importance`
- `@lru_cache` on feature importance for zero disk I/O after first request
- Structured production analysis response schema with 5 grouped sections
- Deterministic investment scoring with ROI + valuation gap + risk penalty
- Deterministic `deal_label` classification: `Buy`, `Hold`, `Avoid`
- LLM-generated investment narrative via OpenAI gpt-5.4-mini (Responses API)
- Per-model-key warning system for low-confidence predictions
- **Unified authentication** on API routes: Supabase **JWT** (`Authorization: Bearer`) or legacy **`X-API-Key`** (timing-safe comparison) — same `get_current_user` dependency for prediction, properties, and auth
- **Role-based access tiers**: `user` (free, 10 AI analyses/day), `paid` (200/day), `admin` (unlimited) — enforced at the LLM service layer and surfaced via `GET /auth/quota`
- **Mapbox server-side monthly cap** — `POST /geocode/usage` returns 429 when org-wide monthly usage hits `MAPBOX_MONTHLY_FREE_REQUEST_CAP`
- Per-IP rate limiting with consistent JSON error envelope (slowapi)
- CORS locked to explicit allowed origins, methods, and headers via environment variable
- Unified error response envelope `{ error, status_code, message, detail }` for all error types
- JSON structured logging with per-request UUID tracing and `X-Request-ID` response header
- `/health` (liveness) and `/ready` (DB connectivity readiness) endpoints
- **74 backend + 112 frontend automated tests** — pytest, monkeypatch, `app.dependency_overrides`; Vitest + React Testing Library
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline running tests on push and PR to `main`
- Docker + Docker Compose for containerized local and cloud deployment

## Project Status

🟢 **Active — Production-Hardened Full-Stack AI Platform**

All Priority 1 bugs resolved. ML model routing complete. Frontend live and integrated. Full production hardening applied (authentication, rate limiting, CORS, error handling, structured logging). 186 total automated tests (74 backend, 112 frontend).

**Current milestone:**
- Full-stack platform live: React 19 frontend talking to FastAPI backend
- **Supabase Auth** integrated: register / login, JWT sessions, `GET`/`PATCH /auth/me` profiles, per-user saved properties; optional **admin** via `profiles.role` and/or `ADMIN_USER_IDS` in server env (full portfolio visibility for admins)
- **Paid tier feature** complete: `user` / `paid` / `admin` roles enforced on LLM quota; `GET /auth/quota` endpoint; quota pill on Analyze page; Paid badge in Navbar; tier card + quota bar + Stripe placeholder on Profile page
- **Medallion data pipeline** implemented: Bronze → Silver normalizers (DOF, ACRIS, J-51, PLUTO) → Gold as-of feature builders → spine-based training
- **Spine v4 models** trained on Gold features with strict time-based splits; overfitting-gate guardrails applied — all metrics are honest forward-time R² values. New anti-overfitting measures: 5-seed VotingRegressor ensemble, rare-neighbourhood collapse, pooled `rentals_all` model
- **BBL inference enrichment**: optional `bbl` + `as_of_date` on `POST /predict-price-v2` and `POST /analyze-property-v2` triggers on-the-fly Silver/PLUTO feature loading at request time, closing the train/inference feature gap
- ModelRegistry + PredictionService + Explainer service layer fully implemented
- Feature importance persisted as ML artifact and cached at runtime
- LLM explanation layer live with structured JSON output
- All prediction endpoints operational with v2 production contract
- Property CRUD fully implemented and validated — `analysis` JSONB column stores full analysis result per property
- Portfolio page redesigned: save analysis from Analyze page, view cards with score, valuations, deal label, and expandable AI explanation
- CI pipeline passing on GitHub Actions

## ✅ Primary API Contract (v2)

The **official product-facing contract is the v2 API layer**.

### Recommended endpoints
These are the endpoints intended for frontend integration, product demos, and ongoing feature expansion:

```text
POST /predict-price-v2
POST /analyze-property-v2
GET  /model/feature-importance
```

### Legacy compatibility endpoints
These routes remain available for backward compatibility:

```text
POST /predict-price
POST /analyze-property
POST /predict
POST /analyze
```

New frontend work should target **v2 only**. Legacy routes are not the primary contract.

## 📊 Data Sources

PropIntel uses real NYC government datasets:

| Dataset | Source | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| NYC Rolling Sales | DOF (5 borough Excel files, current + 2022–2024 historical) | Sales transactions with price, size, building class |
| NYC PLUTO | DCP (CSV, ~858k parcels) | Lat/lon, numfloors, FAR, lot/building dimensions |
| DOF Property Valuation & Assessment | NYC Open Data | Annual tax roll — market + assessed values, year built, units |
| ACRIS Real Property | NYC Open Data (master + legals + parties) | Deed transfers, mortgages with document amounts and dates |
| J-51 Exemption & Abatement | NYC Open Data (historical, tax years ≤ 2018) | Per-BBL abatement amounts, expiry years, active flag |
| NYC Subway Stations | MTA (GTFS, 496 stations) | Lat/lon for nearest-station distance (BallTree haversine) |

### Join strategy
All datasets are joined on **BBL (Borough-Block-Lot)** — the canonical NYC property key. As-of filters prevent future data from leaking into any training row.

---

## 🔀 Model Registry & Subtype Routing

PropIntel uses a `ModelRegistry` to route each prediction request to the most appropriate trained model based on building class.

### Routing table

| Building Class | Model Key | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| `01 ONE FAMILY DWELLINGS` | `one_family` | `one_family_spine_price_model.pkl` |
| `02 TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS`, `03 THREE FAMILY DWELLINGS` | `multi_family` | `multi_family_spine_price_model.pkl` |
| `09`–`17` COOPS / CONDOS | `condo_coop` | `condo_coop_spine_price_model.pkl` |
| `07 RENTALS - WALKUP APARTMENTS` | `rentals_all` | `rentals_all_spine_price_model.pkl` |
| `08 RENTALS - ELEVATOR APARTMENTS` | `rentals_all` | `rentals_all_spine_price_model.pkl` |
| All others | `global` | `price_model.pkl` |

Both rental building classes route to the shared `rentals_all` pooled model. An `is_elevator` binary feature (0 = walkup, 1 = elevator) is injected at inference to preserve the signal.

### Model metadata
Each model has a JSON metadata file in `ml/artifacts/metadata/` that defines:
- `name`, `version`, `segment`
- `artifact_path` — path to the serialized `.pkl`
- `stats_path` — neighborhood stats JSON (loaded at inference for median lookups)
- `numeric_features` + `categorical_features` — exact spine v4 feature lists
- `metrics` — MAE, RMSE, R², median_ape, ΔR² gap and worst-fold R² from time-based evaluation

### Warning system
The `warnings` field in `ProductionPredictionResponse` is populated based on model key:
- `rentals_all` → warning served if `total_units` is missing (falls back to global model)
- `global` → fallback model warning
- `bbl` provided without `as_of_date` (or vice versa) → warning that BBL enrichment was skipped

---

## 📈 Model Performance

### Spine v4 results — time-based split (train ≤ 2024-12-31 / test ≥ 2025-01-31)

| Segment | Test R² | Test MAE | Test Median APE | Target | ΔR² gap | Worst-fold R² | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `one_family` | **0.765** | $238k | 17.2% | sales_price | 0.109 ✅ | 0.755 ✅ | Protected — not retrained |
| `condo_coop` | **0.633** | $421k | 21.4% | sales_price | 0.044 ✅ | 0.594 ✅ | Most stable model |
| `multi_family` | **0.608** | $346k | 20.8% | sales_price | 0.138 ✅ | 0.541 ✅ | v4: 5-seed ensemble + rare-nbhd collapse |
| `rentals_all` | **0.456** | $110k/unit | 25.7% | price_per_unit | 0.131 ✅ | 0.456 ✅ | v4: pooled walkup+elevator, no lat/lon, ensemble |

> All metrics are from a **strict time-based holdout** — no random splits. Train rows: sales up to 2024-12-31. Test rows: sales on or after 2025-01-31 (30-day reporting-lag gap enforced). The ΔR² gap and worst rolling-origin fold R² are the anti-overfitting gates that must both pass before any model is promoted.

> **`rentals_all`** replaces the previous separate `rental_walkup` and `rental_elevator` models. Pooling eliminated the ~350-row data starvation problem for elevator rentals (worst-fold R² improved from 0.280 → 0.456). Both building classes `07` and `08` route to this shared model via the `is_elevator` binary feature.

Rental models predict **price per unit** ($/unit) and multiply by `total_units` at inference to recover the full building sale price.

### Anti-overfitting measures (v4)

| Measure | Segments |
|---|---|
| 5-seed VotingRegressor ensemble | `multi_family`, `rentals_all` |
| Rare-neighbourhood collapse (< 30 train rows → `Other_<Borough>`) | `multi_family` |
| lat/lon excluded (prevents geographic memorisation in small datasets) | `rentals_all` |
| Time-based split instead of random 80/20 | All |
| Rolling-origin fold scorecard gates: ΔR² ≤ 0.15, worst-fold R² ≥ 0.40 | All |

### Feature set

| Group | Features | Segments |
|---|---|---|
| Neighbourhood stats | `neighborhood_median_price`, `dof_assess_per_unit` | All |
| Derived | `property_age`, `borough_name` | All |
| DOF roll | `dof_curmkttot`, `dof_curacttot`, `dof_curactland`, `dof_gross_sqft`, `dof_bld_story`, `dof_units`, `dof_yrbuilt`, `dof_bldg_class`, `dof_tax_class` | All |
| ACRIS | `acris_prior_sale_cnt`, `acris_last_deed_amt`, `acris_days_since_last_deed`, `acris_mortgage_cnt`, `acris_last_mtge_amt` | All |
| J-51 | `j51_active_flag`, `j51_last_abate_amt`, `j51_total_abatement` | All |
| PLUTO geo | `pluto_latitude`, `pluto_longitude`, `subway_dist_km`, `pluto_numfloors`, `pluto_builtfar`, `pluto_bldg_footprint`, `pluto_bldgarea`, `pluto_lotarea`, `pluto_bldgclass` | All except `rentals_all` (no lat/lon) |
| Rental only | `total_units`, `residential_units`, `is_elevator` | `rentals_all` |

### Explainability
Feature importance CSVs for each segment are saved to `ml/artifacts/spine_models/` after training and are loaded at inference time to drive the LLM explanation.

## 🔬 v2 Prediction Request Schema

The primary v2 endpoints use the following standardized request schema:

### `POST /predict-price-v2`

```json
{
  "borough": "Brooklyn",
  "neighborhood": "Park Slope",
  "building_class": "02 TWO FAMILY DWELLINGS",
  "year_built": 1925,
  "gross_sqft": 1800,
  "land_sqft": 2000,
  "latitude": 40.6720,
  "longitude": -73.9778,
  "bbl": "3012340056",
  "as_of_date": "2025-06-15"
}
```

`bbl` and `as_of_date` are **optional**. When both are provided, the API loads DOF / ACRIS / J-51 / PLUTO features from local Silver + Gold parquets using the same as-of rules as training — closing the train/inference feature gap. Without them, the pipeline median-imputes those columns.

### `POST /analyze-property-v2`

Same as above plus:

```json
{
  "market_price": 1250000.0
}
```

## 🧠 ML Inference Architecture

```

For analysis requests, `PredictionService.analyze()` additionally:
1. Computes valuation gap and ROI estimate
2. Scores the investment (0–100) using ROI + valuation gap + risk penalty
3. Classifies deal label: `Buy`, `Hold`, or `Avoid`
4. Loads top feature drivers (cached via `@lru_cache`)
5. Calls OpenAI gpt-5.4-mini for LLM narrative explanation
6. Returns grouped `ProductionAnalyzeResponse`

## ⚙️ Environment Setup

### Backend

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file at the project root (see also `.env.example`):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
API_KEY=your-secret-api-key-here
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5174,http://127.0.0.1:5174
LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.3

# Supabase Auth — backend verifies access tokens (RS256 via JWKS or HS256 via secret)
SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-from-supabase-dashboard

# Optional: comma-separated Supabase user UUIDs treated as app admins
ADMIN_USER_IDS=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

# LLM daily quota limits per role (defaults: free=10, paid=200)
LLM_QUOTA_FREE=10
LLM_QUOTA_PAID=200

# Mapbox monthly org-wide geocoding cap (default: 100000)
MAPBOX_MONTHLY_FREE_REQUEST_CAP=100000
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `frontend/.env` file:

```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

---

## ▶️ Running the App

### Backend

```bash
uvicorn backend.app.main:app --reload
```

Available at:
- API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Swagger UI: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Liveness: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`
- Readiness (DB check): `http://127.0.0.1:8000/ready`

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Available at `http://localhost:5174`

### Initialize the database

```bash
python -m backend.app.db.init_db
```

### Rebuild the ML pipeline from scratch

```bash
# 1. Silver normalizers
python ml/pipelines/silver_dof_assessment.py
python ml/pipelines/silver_acris.py
python ml/pipelines/silver_j51.py

# 2. Spine + Gold features
python ml/pipelines/spine_builder.py
python ml/pipelines/gold_dof_assessment_asof.py
python ml/pipelines/gold_acris_features_asof.py
python ml/pipelines/gold_j51_features_asof.py
python ml/pipelines/gold_pluto_features.py

# 3. Train (one_family excluded from tuning — use train_spine_models.py for it)
python ml/models/train_spine_models.py --subtypes one_family
python ml/models/tune_spine_models.py --trials 60

# 4. Evaluate
python ml/pipelines/eval_protocol.py
```

---

## 🗄️ Database Integration

### Connection

`backend/app/db/database.py` manages:
- SQLAlchemy engine with `pool_pre_ping=True` and `pool_recycle=300`
- Session factory with `autocommit=False`, `autoflush=False`
- `get_db()` dependency injected into all route handlers via `Depends()`

### Models

| Table | Model | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `profiles` | `Profile` | One row per Supabase user: `id` (UUID), `email`, `display_name`, `role` (`user` / `paid` / `admin`), `marketing_opt_in` |
| `properties` | `Property` | Saved property analyses — `user_id` links to owner; `analysis` JSONB stores the full `POST /analyze-property-v2` response |
| `llm_usage` | `LLMUsage` | Per-user daily LLM call counter — enforces `LLM_QUOTA_FREE` / `LLM_QUOTA_PAID` limits |
| `mapbox_usage` | `MapboxUsage` | Per-user daily Mapbox geocode request counter — reported by the frontend, shown in admin dashboard |
| `housing_data` | `HousingData` | NYC training data loaded from CSV pipeline |

---

## 🔍 Testing

Automated tests live in `tests/`.

```bash
pytest
```

### Backend test coverage

| Test file | Tests | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `test_property_api.py` | 15 | CRUD, filters, housing lookup, `UserContext` mocks |
| `test_prediction_api.py` | 9 | All prediction/analysis endpoints, model routing, validation, mock service |
| `test_llm_guardrails.py` | 22 | Schema validation, per-user quota, quota fallback, admin/api_key exemption |
| `test_admin_api.py` | 9 | Admin overview, role PATCH (promote/demote/invalid/403/404), role enrichment |
| `test_quota_api.py` | 7 | GET /auth/quota — free/paid/admin/api_key roles, usage states, 401 |
| `test_auth_me_api.py` | 11 | GET/PATCH /auth/me — auto-creation, display-name backfill, admin promo, 400/401 |

Workflow: `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

---

## 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose

```bash
# Build
docker build -t propintel-api .

# Run with Supabase (cloud PostgreSQL)
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env.docker propintel-api

# Run with Docker Compose (local PostgreSQL)
docker compose up --build
docker compose down
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

- **Model caching** — `ModelRegistry` lazy-loads each segment PKL on first request and holds it in memory; zero disk I/O on subsequent requests for the same key.
- **Feature importance caching** — `@lru_cache` on feature importance loaders; one disk read per server process.
- **Parquet row filters** — `BblFeatureBuilder` pushes BBL equality filters into parquet reads, scanning only matching row groups.
- **BallTree subway distance** — cached at startup via `@lru_cache`; single in-memory haversine query per request.

---

## ⚠️ Model Limitations

- Trained only on **NYC residential properties** — not applicable to commercial.
- `rentals_all` (R²=0.456) pools walkup and elevator rentals to solve elevator's 350-row starvation. The pooled model passes both overfitting gates (ΔR² = 0.131, worst-fold = 0.456) but rental markets are inherently noisy; predictions should be interpreted with the valuation band.
- `multi_family` (R²=0.608) remains heterogeneous across price ranges and boroughs; variance is reduced by the 5-seed ensemble but the market complexity limits further improvement without more data.
- All metrics are from a **strict time-based holdout** — forward-time generalisation, not in-sample or random-split estimates.
- PLUTO match rate is ~76%; parcels without a PLUTO row get median imputation for physical features.
- No temporal or macroeconomic cycle features.

### Future improvements
- Expand SHAP per-property explainability
- Batch prediction endpoint for portfolio analysis
- Rent-stabilisation (DHCR) feature integration for rental segments
- Additional hyperparameter trials or CatBoost for `multi_family`
- Optional admin tools (impersonation / "view as user") with audit logging
